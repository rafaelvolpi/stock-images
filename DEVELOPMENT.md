### Hooks and Filters

The plugin provides several hooks for developers:

#### Actions
- `stock_images_image_imported` - Fired when an image is imported
- `stock_images_before_search` - Fired before performing a search
- `stock_images_after_search` - Fired after performing a search

#### Filters
- `stock_images_search_results` - Filter search results
- `stock_images_image_data` - Filter image data before import
- `stock_images_attribution_text` - Filter attribution text

### Example Usage

```php
// Add custom action when image is imported
add_action('stock_images_image_imported', function($attachment_id, $image_data) {
    // Your custom code here
    error_log('Stock image imported: ' . $attachment_id);
}, 10, 2);

// Filter attribution text
add_filter('stock_images_attribution_text', function($text, $photographer, $photographer_url) {
    return sprintf('Photo by <a href="%s">%s</a> on Stock Images', $photographer_url, $photographer);
}, 10, 3);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"API key not configured"** - Add your API keys in settings
2. **"No images found"** - Check search terms and API limits
3. **Import fails** - Verify file permissions and server connectivity
4. **Media modal not showing** - Check theme compatibility

### Debug Mode
Add to `wp-config.php`:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```
